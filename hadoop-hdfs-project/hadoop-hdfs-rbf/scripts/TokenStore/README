These scripts must be executed to create the TokenStore database, tables and users needed to use the
SQLDelegationTokenSecretManagerImpl as the delegation token secret manager:
1. TokenStoreDatabase.sql
2. TokenStoreTables.sql
3. TokenStoreUser.sql

Note: The TokenStoreUser.sql defines a default user/password. You are highly encouraged to set
this to a proper strong password.
